<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Name is Ian Stopa and this will be my second bachloar's degree. For my first it was for 3D animation.
Though I wanted to do that more as a hobby than as a job so I went to Computer Science. This is my last semester,
 and I can't wait to graduate. To start working toward my hobbies and passions. As stated one is 3D animation, 
 though I also enjoy cars, motorcycles, and aircraft.</p>
<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Collaboration with classmates to mimic a real life atmosphere</li>
  <li>Build a usuable product instead of one shot projects</li>
  <li>See how different software implements with each other to get to said end product.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
<p>As described above, 3D animation is one of my main ones. Really could say animation in general, though I can't draw so I 
gravitate to 3D since I can sculpt or extrude primitives to the desired shape I want. Within the 3D I also got interested 
in 3D rendering techniques. Made a GPU render farm and experimented with different render engines. Which led me to getting a 
Computer Science degree.</p>

<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>I'm A Polish Ginger.</p>
